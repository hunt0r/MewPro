 * The Parallax PIR Sensor is an easy to use digital infrared motion sensor module.
 * ( http://www.parallax.com/product/555-28027 )
 *
 * The sensor's output pin goes to HIGH if motion is present.
 * However, even if motion is present it goes to LOW from time to time,
 * which might give the impression no motion is present.
 * This program deals with this issue by ignoring LOW-phases shorter than a given time,
 * assuming continuous motion is present during these phases.
